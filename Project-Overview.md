CONTEXT

so i need to create a similar app like this one (this repo) but with a different theme and different features. this is going to be for a concrete block production app. So the idea is to extract as much as possible from this repo and use it as a base for the new app.

CLIENT PAIN POINTS

their actual way of doing things is like this:
1. the person in charge of the production of the blocks has to manually write the order in a paper and then give it to the engineer in charge of the production of the blocks. This is a very time consuming process and it is very easy to make mistakes.
2. the person in charge has to manually write the production order specs, like: the type of concrete block, the size of the concrete block, the quantity of concrete blocks produced during this session, the date of the production, the materials used to produce the blocks (water, concrete, sand, etc.), the time of the production, the time it started producing, the time it ended producing, the time it took to produce, who produced the blocks, what specific concrete plant was used to produce the blocks, etc.
3. the person in charge has to manually write the production order specs in a paper and then give it to the engineer in charge of the production of the blocks. Then, the engineer has to manually write the production all the prodruction information in excel to track costs, values, records, etc. The engineer has to do this for every single production order, every single day. 
4. The engineer then has to send this excel file to the person in charge of the production of the blocks to keep track of the production orders. It's also used to track the costs of the production of the blocks, the values of the production of the blocks, the records of the production of the blocks, cost of the materials used to produce the blocks, cost of the labor, cost of the energy, cost of the maintenance, cost of the team, cost of the equipment, etc.
5. Then they use this information to make decisions about the production of the blocks, like: how many blocks to produce, what type of blocks to produce, what size of blocks to produce, what materials to use, what equipment to use, what team to use, etc.
6. this is connected with the inventory of the materials used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the equipment used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the team used to produce the blocks, etc.

CLIENT NEEDS

The client needs an app that can help them to automate the process of creating the production orders, tracking the production orders, tracking the costs of the production of the blocks, tracking the values of the production of the blocks, tracking the records of the production of the blocks, tracking the inventory of the materials used to produce the blocks, tracking the inventory of the equipment used to produce the blocks, tracking the inventory of the team used to produce the blocks, etc.

THE APP

USER FLOW

the app will be used by the person in charge of the production of the blocks and the engineer in charge of the production of the blocks. the person in charge of the production of the blocks will be able to create the production orders and the engineer in charge of the production of the blocks will be able to track the production orders, track the costs of the production of the blocks, track the values of the production of the blocks, track the records of the production of the blocks, track the inventory of the materials used to produce the blocks, track the inventory of the equipment used to produce the blocks, track the inventory of the team used to produce the blocks, etc. The person in charge will be the responsible for inserting the information of each production order in the app. The engineer will be able to see the information of the production orders and the information of the inventory of the materials used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the equipment used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the team used to produce the blocks, etc. This will basically automate the process of creating the excel files daily and will help the engineer to track the production orders, the costs of the production of the blocks, the values of the production of the blocks, the records of the production of the blocks, the inventory of the materials used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the equipment used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the team used to produce the blocks, etc. 

The engineer should be able to see the information of the production orders and the information of the inventory of the materials used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the equipment used to produce the blocks, the inventory of the team used to produce the blocks, etc. 

All the information will be stored in a database and the app will be able to generate reports, graphs, charts, etc. to help the engineer to make decisions about the production of the blocks.

The engineer will be able to access the information through the app Admin dashboard. The person in charge of the production of the blocks will be able to access the information through the app User dashboard.

The person in charge of the production will only have access to the information of the production orders that he/she has created.
The engineer will have access to all the information of the production orders, inventories, etc.

The app will have a login system to authenticate the users. The app will have a registration system to register the users. The app will have a password recovery system to recover the passwords of the users.

The app will have a dashboard for the engineer and a dashboard for the person in charge of the production of the blocks.

The app will have a database to store the information of the production orders, inventories, etc.

The app will have a system to generate reports, graphs, charts, etc. to help the engineer to make decisions about the production of the blocks.



The app will be developed using the following technologies:

- Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- Backend: Supabase
- Deployment: Vercel
