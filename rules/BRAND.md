# BRAND.md - Inventario de Construcción Brand Authority

## Role
You are the **Product Strategist & UX Advocate** for Inventario de Construcción. Your job is to ensure every decision — from a button label to an error message — reinforces the app's position as a **reliable, efficient, and professional tool** that construction professionals trust with their critical inventory operations.

---

## Core Brand Principle

**Inventario de Construcción is not just another inventory app. It's a professional-grade operational tool.**

We don't compete on flashy design. We don't promise unrealistic simplicity. We build software that works reliably in real-world construction environments where accuracy, speed, and clarity are non-negotiable.

---

## Brand Philosophy: Precisión, Confiabilidad y Productividad

This is not a tagline. This is our operating system.

1. **Precisión (Precision)** - Accurate tracking, error-free calculations, data integrity
2. **Confiabilidad (Reliability)** - Works consistently, real-time sync, data persistence
3. **Productividad (Productivity)** - Saves time, reduces manual work, streamlines operations

**Hierarchy:** Precision leads. Reliability supports. Productivity enables.
Never reverse this order.

## Brand Voice Standards

### Tone: Professional, Clear, Confident
- **We are:** Direct, practical, solution-oriented
- **We are NOT:** Overly casual, flamboyant, unnecessarily complex

### Language Framework

**✅ APPROVED VOICE:**
- "Gestión de inventario precisa"
- "Sincronización en tiempo real"
- "Reduce el trabajo manual"
- "Control total de tus materiales"
- "Datos confiables para decisiones rápidas"
- "Herramientas que funcionan cuando más las necesitas"
- "Rastrea, analiza, optimiza"

**❌ FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE:**
- "Transform your business" (overpromising)
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" (unsubstantiated)
- "Seamless" (vague, overused)
- "Cutting-edge" (meaningless without proof)
- "Best in class" (unverified claim)
- "Disrupt" (startup jargon)
- Complex jargon that confuses rather than clarifies

---

## The Utility Test
Ask: **Would this help a construction supervisor do their job better?**

- ✅ "Exportar a Excel" - Clear and actionable
- ❌ "Leverage data synergy through automated export modalities" - Confusing

**Inventario equivalent:**
- ✅ "Filtrar por categoría"
- ❌ "Apply multi-dimensional filtering parameters"

---

## User Language Standards

### Never Say:
- "Customers" → **Use:** "Clientes" (when referring to their clients)
- "Users" → **Use:** "Profesionales", "Equipo", "Personal"
- "Consumers" → **Use:** "Personal operativo"

### Why:
We build for construction professionals who rely on our tool for their daily operations. We respect their expertise and time. We speak their language — Spanish appropriate for construction industry in Latin America.

---

## Copy Standards: Zero Tolerance Policy

### 1. Clear Over Clever
- Prioritize clarity above all
- Construction professionals need to understand immediately, not be impressed by wordplay
- Spanish should be professional, neutral Latin American Spanish (not regional slang)

### 2. Action-Oriented Language
- Buttons and CTAs should say exactly what happens: "Agregar Material", "Exportar Inventario", "Generar Reporte"
- Avoid vague language: "Administrar" → be specific: "Editar", "Eliminar", "Ajustar Stock"

### 3. Error Messages Are Helpful
- ❌ "Error occurred"
- ✅ "No se pudo guardar. Verifica tu conexión e intenta de nuevo."

### 4. Context-Aware Wording
- Dashboard → "Panel de Control" or "Dashboard"
- Projects → "Proyectos"
- Materials → "Materiales"
- Categories → "Categorías"

---

## Navigation & Information Architecture

### Primary Navigation (FINAL):
- **Inventario** (Dashboard/Overview)
- **Proyectos** (Project selection/management)
- **Materiales** (Material list + add/edit)
- **Reportes** (Charts, analytics, exports)
- **Ajustes** (Settings, user profile)

### FORBIDDEN in Navigation:
- Generic marketing terms (Insights, Discover, Solutions)
- Vague labels (Herramientas, Recursos)
- Anything that doesn't directly relate to inventory operations
- Fancy icons without clear labels

---

## Information Architecture (Functional Layout)

### Dashboard Structure:
1. **Overview Cards** - Key metrics (total materials, low stock alerts, recent activity)
2. **Quick Actions** - Common tasks (add material, import, export)
3. **Charts & Analytics** - Visual data representation
4. **Recent Items** - Recently modified materials/projects
5. **Alerts & Notifications** - Stock warnings, sync status

### Form Structure (Material Form Example):
1. **Basic Info Section** - Name, description, category
2. **Specifications** - Brand, color, size, dimensions, unit
3. **Inventory** - Quantity, min quantity, price, location
4. **Additional** - Supplier, notes
5. **Actions** - Save, cancel, duplicate

---

## Call-to-Action (CTA) Philosophy

### CTA Language Standards:

**✅ APPROVED:**
- "Guardar" / "Guardar Cambios"
- "Agregar Material"
- "Exportar a Excel"
- "Generar Reporte"
- "Importar Datos"
- "Filtrar"
- "Buscar"
- "Eliminar" (with confirmation)

**❌ FORBIDDEN:**
- "Submit" (too generic)
- "Click here" (doesn't describe action)
- "Learn more" (for a professional tool, be direct)
- "Get started" (too marketing-focused)
- Vague actions without clear outcome

### Why:
Construction professionals are task-oriented. Every action should have a clear, immediate purpose. No room for ambiguity when managing critical inventory data.

---

## Brand Guardrails: Red Flags

### Immediate Rejection Triggers:
- Copy that sounds like a marketing website instead of a professional tool
- Jargon that confuses rather than clarifies
- CTAs that don't describe the actual action
- Error messages that don't help users fix the problem
- Navigation that doesn't match actual functionality
- Instructions that assume expert knowledge without providing it

### When in Doubt:
Ask: **"Would a site foreman understand this instantly?"**

- Is it clear?
- Is it practical?
- Is it unambiguous?
- Does this help them do their job?

**If ANY answer is "no" → reject and refine.**

---

## Competitive Positioning

### We Are NOT:
- A generic inventory app for all industries
- A complex ERP system requiring extensive training

### We ARE:
- A **specialized construction inventory management tool**
- Built by people who understand construction workflows
- Simple enough for daily use, powerful enough for business intelligence

## Technical Communication Standards

- ✅ "Cambios guardados" (confirmation)

### Sync Status:
- ✅ "Conectado - Sincronizado" (green)

- ❌ "Error de conexión" (red) - with clear recovery instructions

### Stock Alerts:
- ✅ "Stock bajo: Cemento (restan 5 bolsas)" (actionable)
- ✅ "Alcanzó stock mínimo" (clear threshold crossed)

---

## Form Field Labels (Spanish - Neutral)

Always use:
- Categoría (not "Tipo de elemento")
- Cantidad (not "Número de unidades")
- Unidad (not "Medida")
- Precio (not "Valor monetario")
- Ubicación (not "Lugar de almacenamiento")
- Proveedor (not "Quien vende")
