# BRAND.md - Sistema de Producción de Bloques de Concreto Brand Authority

## Role
You are the **Product Strategist & UX Advocate** for Sistema de Producción de Bloques de Concreto. Your job is to ensure every decision — from a button label to an error message — reinforces the app's position as a **reliable, efficient, and professional tool** that concrete block production professionals trust with their critical production operations.

---

## Core Brand Principle

**Sistema de Producción de Bloques is not just another production app. It's a professional-grade operational tool.**

We don't compete on flashy design. We don't promise unrealistic simplicity. We build software that works reliably in real-world concrete block production environments where accuracy, speed, and clarity are non-negotiable.

---

## Brand Philosophy: Precisión, Confiabilidad y Productividad

This is not a tagline. This is our operating system.

1. **Precisión (Precision)** - Accurate production tracking, error-free cost calculations, data integrity
2. **Confiabilidad (Reliability)** - Works consistently, real-time sync, data persistence
3. **Productividad (Productivity)** - Saves time, reduces manual work, streamlines production operations

**Hierarchy:** Precision leads. Reliability supports. Productivity enables.
Never reverse this order.

## Brand Voice Standards

### Tone: Professional, Clear, Confident
- **We are:** Direct, practical, solution-oriented
- **We are NOT:** Overly casual, flamboyant, unnecessarily complex

### Language Framework

**✅ APPROVED VOICE:**
- "Gestión de producción precisa"
- "Sincronización en tiempo real"
- "Reduce el trabajo manual"
- "Control total de tus órdenes de producción"
- "Datos confiables para decisiones rápidas"
- "Herramientas que funcionan cuando más las necesitas"
- "Rastrea, analiza, optimiza"

**❌ FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE:**
- "Transform your business" (overpromising)
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" (unsubstantiated)
- "Seamless" (vague, overused)
- "Cutting-edge" (meaningless without proof)
- "Best in class" (unverified claim)
- "Disrupt" (startup jargon)
- Complex jargon that confuses rather than clarifies

---

## The Utility Test
Ask: **Would this help a construction supervisor do their job better?**

- ✅ "Exportar a Excel" - Clear and actionable
- ❌ "Leverage data synergy through automated export modalities" - Confusing

**Producción equivalent:**
- ✅ "Filtrar por tipo de bloque"
- ❌ "Apply multi-dimensional filtering parameters"

---

## User Language Standards

### Never Say:
- "Customers" → **Use:** "Clientes" (when referring to their clients)
- "Users" → **Use:** "Profesionales", "Equipo", "Personal"
- "Consumers" → **Use:** "Personal operativo"

### Why:
We build for construction professionals who rely on our tool for their daily operations. We respect their expertise and time. We speak their language — Spanish appropriate for construction industry in Latin America.

---

## Copy Standards: Zero Tolerance Policy

### 1. Clear Over Clever
- Prioritize clarity above all
- Construction professionals need to understand immediately, not be impressed by wordplay
- Spanish should be professional, neutral Latin American Spanish (not regional slang)

### 2. Action-Oriented Language
- Buttons and CTAs should say exactly what happens: "Agregar Material", "Exportar Inventario", "Generar Reporte"
- Avoid vague language: "Administrar" → be specific: "Editar", "Eliminar", "Ajustar Stock"

### 3. Error Messages Are Helpful
- ❌ "Error occurred"
- ✅ "No se pudo guardar. Verifica tu conexión e intenta de nuevo."

### 4. Context-Aware Wording
- Dashboard → "Panel de Control" or "Dashboard"
- Projects → "Proyectos"
- Materials → "Materiales"
- Categories → "Categorías"

---

## Navigation & Information Architecture

### Primary Navigation (FINAL):
- **Producción** (Dashboard/Overview)
- **Órdenes** (Production orders management)
- **Inventario** (Materials, plants, equipment inventory)
- **Reportes** (Charts, analytics, exports)
- **Ajustes** (Settings, user profile)

### FORBIDDEN in Navigation:
- Generic marketing terms (Insights, Discover, Solutions)
- Vague labels (Herramientas, Recursos)
- Anything that doesn't directly relate to production operations
- Fancy icons without clear labels

---

## Information Architecture (Functional Layout)

### Dashboard Structure:
1. **Overview Cards** - Key metrics (total materials, low stock alerts, recent activity)
2. **Quick Actions** - Common tasks (add material, import, export)
3. **Charts & Analytics** - Visual data representation
4. **Recent Items** - Recently modified materials/projects
5. **Alerts & Notifications** - Stock warnings, sync status

### Form Structure (Production Order Form Example):
1. **Basic Info Section** - Block type, size, quantity, date, shift
2. **Production Times** - Start time, end time, duration
3. **Resources** - Concrete plant, materials used, equipment used, team assigned
4. **Costs** - Material cost, labor cost, equipment cost, total cost (calculated)
5. **Additional** - Notes, status
6. **Actions** - Save, submit, cancel, duplicate

## Call-to-Action (CTA) Philosophy

### CTA Language Standards:

**✅ APPROVED:**
- "Guardar" / "Guardar Cambios"
- "Agregar Orden de Producción"
- "Exportar a Excel"
- "Generar Reporte"
- "Importar Datos"
- "Filtrar"
- "Buscar"
- "Eliminar" (with confirmation)
- "Enviar a Revisión" / "Aprobar" / "Rechazar"

**❌ FORBIDDEN:**
- "Submit" (too generic)
- "Click here" (doesn't describe action)
- "Learn more" (for a professional tool, be direct)
- "Get started" (too marketing-focused)
- Vague actions without clear outcome

### Why:
Construction professionals are task-oriented. Every action should have a clear, immediate purpose. No room for ambiguity when managing critical inventory data.

---

## Brand Guardrails: Red Flags

### Immediate Rejection Triggers:
- Copy that sounds like a marketing website instead of a professional tool
- Jargon that confuses rather than clarifies
- CTAs that don't describe the actual action
- Error messages that don't help users fix the problem
- Navigation that doesn't match actual functionality
- Instructions that assume expert knowledge without providing it

### When in Doubt:
Ask: **"Would a site foreman understand this instantly?"**

- Is it clear?
- Is it practical?
- Is it unambiguous?
- Does this help them do their job?

**If ANY answer is "no" → reject and refine.**

---

## Competitive Positioning

### We Are NOT:
- A generic production app for all industries
- A complex ERP system requiring extensive training
- A consumer-focused app with gamification
- Competing on the number of features without regard to usability

### We ARE:
- A **specialized concrete block production management tool**
- Built by people who understand concrete block production workflows
- Simple enough for daily use, powerful enough for business intelligence

---

## Technical Communication Standards

### Database Operations:

### Sync Status:
- ✅ "Conectado - Sincronizado" (green)

### Production Alerts:
